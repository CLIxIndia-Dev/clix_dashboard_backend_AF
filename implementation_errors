1. Need to consider cases of no tools data in school gstudio folder. This was throwing error for mz82 and mz87.
2. Have added a variable to capture schools updated on every day. Only when there is gstudio folder in synced folder, 
   a school is registered in the variable.
3. Empty data could be due to the date range given also
4. When generating data for lab usage, we consider only latest time interval of observation. So get the aggregate numbers for
   all the days so far, need to add up the increments for each column.

1. Perfect way to debug is to comment out loading to db part of the code and paste the list of all schools from school_update_list of variables.
2. Need to find a way to isolate error at school level, so that we dont have to rerun all the steps. Looks like we have decouple syncing part and 
   loading the tables part, so that when an error appears we can just do the loading of tables part instead of the whole syncing and loading.

1. when creating new volume in airflow directory, make sure that 'airflow' inside airflow docker has same userid as the host of the docker. Find the 
userid of host using 'user -id show' and pass it as argument 'DOCKER_UID'

# 4th Nov, 2019:
1. We didnt consider the possibility of a school synced for the first time, in which case we would have prev_update_date and curr_update_date not reflecting the 
   actual time period for which a school needs to be processed. Need to store prev_update_date and curr_update_date for very school in every state. Currently, we
   are doing it at state level.
