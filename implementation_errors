1. Need to consider cases of no tools data in school gstudio folder. This was throwing error for mz82 and mz87.
2. Have added a variable to capture schools updated on every day. Only when there is gstudio folder in synced folder, 
   a school is registered in the variable.
3. Empty data could be due to the date range given also
4. When generating data for lab usage, we consider only latest time interval of observation. So get the aggregate numbers for
   all the days so far, need to add up the increments for each column.
